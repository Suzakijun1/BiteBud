## Bite-Bud

Bite-Bud is a web application that allows users to search for local restaurants and attractions in any city and state of their choice. The application retrieves data from third-party APIs to provide users with relevant information about nearby restaurants and attractions.

## Description

Bite-Bud uses the Restaurants Near Me API to search for nearby restaurants based on the user's inputted location. The application returns information such as the restaurant's name, address, phone number, cuisine type, and hours of operation. The application also provides a link to the restaurant's website, if available.

In addition to the restaurant search, Bite-Bud also uses the YouTube API to search for relevant attraction videos based on the user's inputted location. These videos provide users with more information about local attractions and events.

## Usage

No installation is required to use Bite-Bud. To use the application, simply enter the city and state of your choice in the search bar and click the "Search" button. Bite-Bud will retrieve and display a list of local restaurants and YouTube videos related to the location you entered.
